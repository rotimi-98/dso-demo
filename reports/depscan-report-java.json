{"id": "CVE-2022-22965", "package": "org.springframework:spring-beans", "package_type": "org.springframework", "package_usage": "N/A", "version": ">=5.3.0-<5.3.18", "fix_version": "5.3.18", "severity": "CRITICAL", "cvss_score": "9.0", "short_description": "# Remote Code Execution in Spring Framework\nSpring Framework prior to versions 5.2.20 and 5.3.18 contains a remote code execution vulnerability known as `Spring4Shell`. \n\n## Impact\n\nA Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However, the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be other ways to exploit it.\n\nThese are the prerequisites for the exploit:\n- JDK 9 or higher\n- Apache Tomcat as the Servlet container\n- Packaged as WAR\n- `spring-webmvc` or `spring-webflux` dependency\n\n## Patches\n\n- Spring Framework [5.3.18](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18) and [5.2.20](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE)\n- Spring Boot [2.6.6](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6) and [2.5.12](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12)\n\n## Workarounds\n\nFor those who are unable to upgrade, leaked reports recommend setting `disallowedFields` on `WebDataBinder` through an `@ControllerAdvice`. This works generally, but as a centrally applied workaround fix, may leave some loopholes, in particular if a controller sets `disallowedFields` locally through its own `@InitBinder` method, which overrides the global setting.\n\nTo apply the workaround in a more fail-safe way, applications could extend `RequestMappingHandlerAdapter` to update the `WebDataBinder` at the end after all other initialization. In order to do that, a Spring Boot application can declare a `WebMvcRegistrations` bean (Spring MVC) or a `WebFluxRegistrations` bean (Spring WebFlux).\n\n            ", "related_urls": ["https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22965", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/002546b3e4b8d791ea6acccb81eb3168f51abb15", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-254054.pdf", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.5.12", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/releases/tag/v2.6.6", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.2.20.RELEASE", "https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/releases/tag/v5.3.18", "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2022-0005", "https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement", "https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2022-22965", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-java-spring-rce-Zx9GUc67", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/166713/Spring4Shell-Code-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167011/Spring4Shell-Spring-Framework-Class-Property-Remote-Code-Execution.html"]}

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version 2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache Logging Services projects.", "related_urls": ["https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/2", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165225/Apache-Log4j2-2.14.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211210-0007/", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/3", "https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0032", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VU57UJDCFIASIO35GC55JMKSRXJMCDFM/", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/13/1", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/13/2", "https://twitter.com/kurtseifried/status/1469345530182455296", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00007.html", "https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-5020", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-661247.pdf", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165270/Apache-Log4j2-2.14.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165260/VMware-Security-Advisory-2021-0028.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165261/Apache-Log4j2-2.14.1-Information-Disclosure.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/14/4", "https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00646.html", "https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/930724", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165282/Log4j-Payload-Generator.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165281/Log4j2-Log4Shell-Regexes.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165306/L4sh-Log4j-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165307/Log4j-Remote-Code-Execution-Word-Bypassing.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165311/log4j-scan-Extensive-Scanner.html", "http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/15/3", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-714170.pdf", "https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/12/11/microsofts-response-to-cve-2021-44228-apache-log4j2/", "https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-479842.pdf", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165371/VMware-Security-Advisory-2021-0028.4.html", "https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-397453.pdf", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165532/Log4Shell-HTTP-Header-Injection.html", "https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/M5CSVUNV4HWZZXGOKNSK6L7RPM7BOKIB/", "https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db/blob/develop/SOFTWARE-LIST.md", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165642/VMware-vCenter-Server-Unauthenticated-Log4Shell-JNDI-Injection-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165673/UniFi-Network-Application-Unauthenticated-Log4Shell-Remote-Code-Execution.html", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html", "https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db", "https://www.bentley.com/en/common-vulnerability-exposure/be-2022-0001", "https://support.apple.com/kb/HT213189", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Mar/23", "https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html", "https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/CVE-mitre/tree/main/CVE-2021-44228", "https://www.nu11secur1ty.com/2021/12/cve-2021-44228.html", "http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/Jul/11", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167794/Open-Xchange-App-Suite-7.10.x-Cross-Site-Scripting-Command-Injection.html", "http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167917/MobileIron-Log4Shell-Remote-Command-Execution.html"]}
